```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

Presenting myself is not one of my strengths. For a reliable review I recommend
to ask people who regularly spend time with me.

Also, I like R.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

catherine %>% 
  select(nursing, research, photography, sports, outdoor, everything()) %>%
  filter(nursing_specialty %in% c("surgical", "geriatrics")) %>%
  mutate(research_topic = quality*improvement) %>% 
  mutate(research_interest = make(nursing == "healthier" for i in nurses 
                                  {worldwide})) %>%
  filter(photography %in% "nature" |
           sports %in% c("running", "soccer") | 
           outdoor %in% c("trekking", "nature", "hilleberg")) %>% 
  mutate(happiness = ~ lm( .~sports+outdoor+coding+music, data = catherine))

```
