      <description>About Me Hi, my name is Catherine Blatter 👋
I am a registered general nurse (RN) located in Switzerland - during my master’s studies at the Institute of Nursing Science in Basel I discovered a passion for coding in #rstats.
 🏥 my clinical interests lie primarily in adult acute-care surgical nursing, more specifically general and thoracic surgery.
 👴 my research interest is health services research - currently mostly with data from nursing homes.</description>
